(b) 9 commits have been done. I used 'git log' to find this.

(c) It was last modified on Wednesday, September 27, 16:31:42 2017.
    I used 'git log --follow .gitignore'.

(e) A development branch can contain unstable
    code without putting the master branch at risk.

    One can work on seperate features using a branch
    and later merge final product.

(f) 'git log' shows the commit logs.
    'git status' shows the working tree status.

(g) git log --follow Weapon.h

(h) git log --grep="file"

    (I) Inheritance is a technique that relies on an "is a" relationship.
        With this relationship, derived classes can inherit data and functionality
        from their base class.

    (II) Polymorphism is used with inheritance to allow specification when it comes
         to calling on a function that is included in a parent and child class.

    (III) Encapsulation refers to the scope of every function/data has
          within the program. Functions/data members can only be used inside its
          respected encapsulation.

	The program is using both polymorphism and encapsulation. It uses
	polymorphism when calling the hit function through the child classes.
	It uses encapsulation when accessing certain data/functions through
	different files.
